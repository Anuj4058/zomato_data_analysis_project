Generated meaningful insights based on trends observed in the data.

Answering Business Questions: The project addresses the following key business questions:

1)What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?

   Analyzed the frequency of orders across different types of restaurants to identify customer preferences.

2)How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?
